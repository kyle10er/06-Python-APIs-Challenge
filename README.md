# 06-Python-APIs-Challenge

This is my submission for the Python APIs Challenge.  I worked with my peers (Chau Nguyen, Katie Ballinger, Sarah Schilling) to create the code for the UPENN Data Science Bootcamp. I used the knowledge that I learned through the different modules to answer the questions provided. Please ignore the copy of the repository in the Starter code folder.
